# YOE AI Sales Bot Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the YOE AI Sales Bot Project! This project is part of an initiative at YOE (Your EV Online), a startup company focused on selling electric vehicles online (fictional). Our goal is to design a human-like AI system that enhances the online sales process by exhibiting a unique personality and adapting to different psychological states of customers.

## Project Overview

The YOE AI Sales Bot is designed to interact with potential customers, providing information about our electric vehicles (EVs), answering queries, and guiding them through the sales process. The bot is equipped with capabilities to detect and respond to various customer emotions and personality traits, ensuring a personalized and effective sales experience.
